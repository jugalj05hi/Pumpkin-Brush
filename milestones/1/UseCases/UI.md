# Use Case - User Interface

<hr>

**Use Case**: Provide a user interface for the program

**Primary Actor**: Users

**Goal in Context**: To provide an intutive user interface for the program to help users perform tasks easily

**Preconditions**: The tasks abstracted in the user interface should be working and the program should be in running and responsive state

**Trigger**: When the program starts, UI should follow along
  
**Scenario**: The user would be greeted with the UI as soon as the program is running and would stay there unless user quits the program 
 
**Exceptions**: The UI might break upon byzantine behavior of application or user. 

**Priority**: Mid-level Priority

**When available**: Post first MVP 

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through I/O devices. This includes the keyboard and the mouse. The system is responsible for compiling the program and executing the binary file. The user is responsible for all other input i.e. writing commands to execute the program.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: None as of now
