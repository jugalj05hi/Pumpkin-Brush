# Feature Use Case

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Changing canvas color*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *To change the color of the painting canvas (i.e., background color)*

**Preconditions**: *The program must be running and in a responsive state*

**Trigger**: *Press the key (b) combined with the number key between 1 and 8 to change to the specific color: 1) black, 2) white, 3) red, 4) green, 5) blue, 6) yellow, 7) magenta, and 8) cyan. (Or it's done through GUI by left-clicking on the corresponding background color icon with the mouse)*
  
**Scenario**: *A user will press key (b) with a number key between 1 and 8 to choose/change to a specific background color (or left-click on a corresponding icon for a specific background color).*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may be unresponsive. In this case, the user may need to re-start the program*

**Priority**: *Mid-priority*

**When available**: *First-relase*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates with the system through I/O devices. In the current case, the input device is key (b) plus key 1 - 8 (or a left-clicking mouse event) and the system should respond to any of such user generated key pressing (or mouse-clicking) event*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *Consider the range of canvas color options to be the same as the brush painting color options.*
