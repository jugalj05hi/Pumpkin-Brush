# Feature Use Case 

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Clear the canvas*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *To erase everything on the canvas to allow re-drawing*

**Preconditions**: *The program must be running and in a responsive state*

**Trigger**: *Pressing the space key on the keyboard*
  
**Scenario**: *A user will press the space key when they want to scrach their current drawing and start a new one*
 
**Exceptions**: *The canvas may already be blank, which clearing the canvas will not make any different visually*

**Priority**: *Mid-priority*

**When available**: *First release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates through I/O devices. In this specific case, the input is the keyboard device. The system responds to the input by re-creating a new canvas and displaying it in the window*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *May need to implement an eraser function that erases particular locations in the future instead of wiping the entire canvas clean every time*
